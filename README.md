# A Toolbox for Benchmarking of Multi-Component Signal Methods

We introduce a public, open-source, Python-based toolbox for benchmarking multi-component signal analysis methods, implemented either in Python or Matlab.

The goal of this toolbox is providing the signal-processing community with a common framework that allows researcher-independent comparisons between methods and favors reproducible research.
